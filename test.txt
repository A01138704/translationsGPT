Where a_c is the centripetal acceleration, v is the velocity, and r is the radius of curvature.

1.7.3 Example Application: A car travels at 25 meters per second along a circular track with a radius of 10 meters. What is its centripetal acceleration?

Let's plug in the values: a_c = (25² / 10) = 6.25 m/s²

1.7.4 Additional Resources:

**1.8 Fuerza centrípeta**

1.8.1 Definition: The centripetal force is the force required to keep an object moving in a circular path.
