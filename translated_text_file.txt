1.1 Instantaneous Angular Acceleration
1.1.1 Definition
The definition of instantaneous angular acceleration is the change in angular velocity
in an infinitesimally small time period, and graphically corresponds to the value
of the slope of a straight line that touches tangentially a point on a graph of
angular velocity against time.

1.1.2 Formula
The formula for instantaneous angular acceleration is determined by obtaining the derivative
of the angular velocity function with respect to time. It is calculated using the following
formula:

ð¼ =
ð‘¥ð‘£
ð‘¥ð·

In this formula, instantaneous angular acceleration:
ð›¼ is the instantaneous angular acceleration in radians per second squared (rad/s2).
ð‘¥ð‘£ is the differential of angular velocity in radians per second (rad/s).
ð‘¥ð· is the differential of time in seconds (s) during which the infinitesimal change occurs.
Here is the translation:

Small Angular Velocity Change

The unit of measurement for instantaneous acceleration is radians per second squared (rad/s2).

1.1.3 Example Application

A subsequent application of instantaneous angular acceleration is presented with the following problem: A wheel is rotating and its angular velocity varies over time according to the equation ð = ððð â ð’ð’, where the angular velocity (ð) is in radians per second (rad/s) and the time (t) is in seconds (s). Determine the angular acceleration (ðœ¶) of the wheel at 3 seconds.

To determine the angular acceleration (Î±) of the wheel at 3 seconds, you first need to find the derivative of the angular velocity (Ï) with respect to time (t). The angular acceleration (Î±) is the derivative of the velocity.

Given the equation for the angular velocity:

ðœ” = 3ð‘¡
2 â 4ð‘¡

We take the derivative of this equation with respect to time (t) to find the angular acceleration Î±:

Î± =
ð‘‘ðœ”
ð‘‘ð‘¡

Applying the power rule for deriving terms in t:

Î± =
ð‘‘
í±‘ð‘¡
(3ð‘¡
2 â’ 4ð‘¡)

Î± = 6ð‘¡ â’ 4

Now, to find the angular acceleration at 3 seconds (t = 3), simply substitute t = 3 into the equation:

Î± = 6(3) â’ 4 = 18 â’ 4 = 14 rad/s2

Therefore, the angular acceleration of the wheel at 3 seconds is 14 radians per second squared.

1.2 Angular Acceleration Average

1.2.1 Definition
The definition of average angular acceleration is the ratio of change in angular velocity to a given time, graphically corresponding to the slope of a straight line connecting two points on a graph of angular velocity against time.

1.2.2 Formula
Average angular acceleration is obtained by dividing the change in angular velocity by the interval of time, as shown in the following formula:

ð›¼ð‘¡ð‘’ð‘‘ = ðœ”ð‘“ â’ ðœ”ð‘– ð·ð‘¡

In this formula for average angular acceleration:

ð›¼ð‘¡ð‘’ð‘‘ is the average angular acceleration in radians per second squared (rad/s2).

ðœ”ð‘“ is the final angular velocity in radians per second (rad/s).

ðœ”ð‘– is the initial angular velocity in radians per second (rad/s).

â†ð‘¡ is the interval of time in seconds (s) during which the change in angular velocity â†ðœ” occurs.

1.2.3 Example Application

A subsequent application of average angular acceleration is presented with the following problem: A wheel starts from rest and reaches an angular velocity of 8 radians per second in a time of 4 seconds. Determine its average angular acceleration.

The problem data are:

Initial angular velocity ðœ”ð‘– = 0 ðŸ’¸ðŸ“¯ðŸ‘‘/s,

Final angular velocity ðœ”ð‘“ = 8 ðŸ’¸ðŸ“¯ðŸ‘‘/s

Interval of time â†ð‘¡ = 4 s

Substituting these values into the formula, we have:

ð›¼ð‘¡ð‘’ð‘‘ = ðœ”ð‘“ â’ ðœ”ð‘– ð·ð‘¡ = 8 â’ 0 4 = 2 ðŸ’¸ðŸ“¯ðŸ‘‘/s

Here is the translation of the provided text into English:

**Angular Velocity Change**

The formula for angular velocity change is:

Δω = ωf - ωi

where Δω is the change in angular velocity in radians per second (rad/s), ωf is the final angular velocity in radianes per second (rad/s), and ωi is the initial angular velocity in radianes per second (rad/s).

**Example of Application**

A wheel rotates at an angular velocity of 10 radians per second and reduces its rotational motion until it has an angular velocity of 6 radians per second. Determine the change in its angular velocity.

The problem data are: initial angular velocity ωi = 10 rad/s, final angular velocity ωf = 6 rad/s. Substituting these values into the formula gives:

Δω = ωf - ωi = 6 - 10 = -4 rad/s

The change in angular velocity is negative because it reduces the rotation speed.

**Angular Displacement**

The definition of angular displacement is a measure of angle that can be represented by Δθ and refers to the change that an object presents in its angle of movement during circular motion (also called rotational motion) of radius R.

**Formula**

Mathematically, angular displacement is obtained by subtracting the initial position angle (θi) from the final position angle (θf), according to the following formula:

Δθ = θf - θi

The unit of measurement is the radian (rad) in the International System of Units (SI), but it can also be used in degrees (°) or revolutions (rev) to measure angular displacement, where conversion factors must be applied:

1 rev = 2π rad, 1 rev=360°, a π rad = 180°, 1 rad=57.3°

**Relationship with Arc Length**

To relate the angular displacement to the linear distance traveled in that circular trajectory, also known as arc length, the angular displacement must be in radians (rad) and multiplying it by the radius R in meters (m) of the circular trajectory gives that arc length in meters (m) for that angular displacement, which is: arc length = Δθ R.

**Example of Application**

Consider the case of an object that makes a complete turn on a circular trajectory, for example: a wheel with a 10-meter radius.

In this case, the angular displacement is:

1 revolution = 360° = 2π rad

For this case, the arc length of that angular displacement is:

arc length = (2π)(10) = 62.832 m, which corresponds to the perimeter of that circular circumference formed by the wheel.

**Conclusions on Angular Displacement**

In conclusion, angular displacement has important applications for calculating distances, both angular and linear, but also for determining the rotational speed of the object in that circular motion, known as angular velocity.

**Revolutions per Minute**

**Definition**

According to its definition, revolutions per minute (RPM) correspond to the number of turns or revolutions that an object makes in one minute on a circular trajectory of radius (R) and is a measure of the rotational speed or angular velocity of an object. This concept is often used to measure the rotational speed of motors, wheels, fans, and different types of machines where there are rotational movements.

**Formula**

The formula for revolutions per minute is obtained by taking the number of turns or revolutions that an object makes in one minute on a circular trajectory of radius (R) and is a measure of the rotational speed or angular velocity of an object.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

**1.5.3 Example of Application**

Next, we will present an example of applying revolutions per minute:

Consider a rotating wheel that rotates at a rate of two turns every 5 seconds, determining the value of RPM. First, change the 5 seconds to minutes, which is:
(5 ðŸ•°ï¸) (
1 ðŸ“ðŸ‘–

ðŸŽ‰ðŸ‘¥ðŸ”¢ = 24 ðŸŽ‰ðŸ‘¥ðŸ”¢

Therefore, it is concluded that the wheel rotates at a rate of 24 revolutions per minute.

**1.6 Instantaneous Angular Velocity**

**1.6.1 Definition:**
The definition of instantaneous angular velocity, also known as instantaneous angular speed, refers to the speed at which an object rotates in a specific point at an infinitely small time interval.

**1.6.2 Formula:**
Instantaneous angular velocity or instantaneous angular speed is determined from the position function with respect to time using the following formula:

ðŸ“ = Angular displacement measured in [rad].
t = Time taken to perform the position change measured in [s].

**1.6.3 Example Application**

Next, we will present an example application of instantaneous angular velocity or instantaneous angular speed:

Calculate the angular velocity at instant t=5 seconds.

**1.7 Centripetal Acceleration with Circular Motion**

**1.7.1 Definition:**
The definition of centripetal acceleration, also known as radial acceleration with circular motion, is the acceleration that an object or particle experiences when it moves along a curved trajectory and points towards the center of the curved path. It is responsible for keeping an object in motion along a curved path, such as a car turning on a curve.

**1.7.2 Formula:**
Centripetal acceleration or radial acceleration with circular motion is defined as the square of the tangential velocity divided by the radius. Its unit is meter per second squared (m/s2
) and it is obtained from the following formula:

ðŸŽ‰ðŸ‘¥ðŸ”¢ =

**1.8 Centripetal Force**

**1.8.1 Definition**

The definition of centripetal force is a force that acts on an object following a circular trajectory and is directed towards the center of the curve. Its purpose is to keep the object moving along this circular trajectory instead of moving in a straight line. The centripetal force is necessary to overcome the natural tendency of an object to move in a straight line due to inertia. Its magnitude depends on the mass of the object, its angular velocity, and the radius of trajectory.

**1.8.2 Formula**

The formula for centripetal force can be obtained as follows:

F = m × v² / R

Where:
F = centripetal force [N]
m = mass [kg]
v = tangential velocity [m/s]
R = radius [m]

**1.8.3 Example of Application**

You can see an example of the application of centripetal force in the following problem:

Calculate the centripetal force acting on a 900.0 kg car that travels around a curve of 500.0 m radius at a speed of 25.00 m/s.

Step 1: Remember the formula
F = m × v² / R

Step 2: Substitute values
F = 900 × (25)² / 500 = 1.125 N

**1.10 Instantaneous Acceleration**

**1.10.1 Definition**

Instantaneous acceleration is the reason for change in an object's velocity at a specific point in time. When the average acceleration of an object changes over different intervals of time, we use instantaneous acceleration.

The following video explains the definition of instantaneous acceleration:
(https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fisicabotv2-ae102.appspot.com/o/Videos%2FURL_aceleracion_instantanea.mp4?alt=media&token=f23e5d9e-d217-4f29-8b69-d5085ca93af3)

**1.10.2 Formula**

The formula for instantaneous acceleration can be calculated as the derivative of velocity with respect to time. In a graph of velocity vs. time, instantaneous acceleration is the slope of the tangent line.

a(t) = dv/dt

Where:
a(t) = instantaneous acceleration [m/s²]
v(t) = velocity [m/s]

**1.10.3 Example of Application**

Here is an example application of instantaneous acceleration with the following problem:

A particle is moving and accelerating. The function of velocity is v(t) = 20t - 5t² (m/s).

a) Calculate the function of acceleration.
b) Calculate the instantaneous acceleration for t=1 s and v = 5 m/s.

Here is the translation of the provided text to English:

**Derivative of Velocity**

ðð = ð(20ð¡ â 5ð¡2)

ðð = ðð â ððð ()

**Step 2: Evaluate the Fusion of Acceleration for t=1s and later for t=5s**

ð‘(ð‘¡ = 1) = 20 â (10 â 1) = 10 ()

**Acceleration Medium**

**Definition**

Acceleration medium is the rate at which velocity changes. It is calculated by dividing the change in velocity over a given interval of time by the duration of that interval.

**Formula**

Mathematically, acceleration medium is expressed as:

ð‘ = âð‘£ / â†ð‘¡

Where: 
ð‘ is the acceleration medium
âΔv is the difference between the final and initial velocities
âΔt is the duration of the time interval.

The typical unit for acceleration medium in the International System is meters per second squared (m/s²).

**Example Application**

Subsequently, we present an example application of acceleration medium with the following problem: A plane, which starts from rest, moves along the runway with constant acceleration during 18s and then takes off at a speed of 60 m/s. What is the acceleration medium of the plane?

Substitute values into the formula.

ð‘ = â†ð‘£ / â†ð‘¡
= (60 â’ 0) / (18 â’ 0)
= 3.33 ()

**Direction Angles**

**Definition**

The term "direction angles" is used in trigonometry and analytic geometry to describe the angles that a vector forms with the coordinate axes in a three-dimensional coordinate system (x, y, z).

Direction angles are used to describe the three-dimensional orientation of a vector. These angles are useful in physics, engineering, and other disciplines to represent the direction of forces, moments, velocities, or other vector quantities in a three-dimensional coordinate system.

ð‘ = angle between the x-axis and the three-dimensional vector.
ðŸ½ = angle between the y-axis and the three-dimensional vector.
ðŸ¾ = angle between the z-axis and the three-dimensional vector.

**Formula**

The formulas for direction angles are as follows:

For ðŸ¼: 
ð‘ð‘ð‘ ðŸ¼ = ð´ð‘¥ / |ð´ |

Formula b:
ð‘ð‘ð‘ ðŸ½ = ð´ð‘¦ / |ð´ |

Formula c:
ð‘ð‘ð‘ ðŸ¾ = ð´ð‘§ / |ð´ |

**Example Application**

Subsequently, we present an example application of direction angles with the following problem: Obtain the direction angles of the vector: ð´ = 2ð‘â¢ â’ ð‘â¢ â’ 2ð‘Œâ¢

Step 1. Identify the components of the vector 
ð´ð‘¥ â¢â¢â¢â¢ = 2
ð´ð‘¦ â¢â¢â¢â¢ = â’1
ð´ð‘§ â¢â¢â¢â¢ = â’2

Step 2. Calculate the magnitude of the vector 
ð‘¨â¢ = âðŸðŸ + â’ðŸ
ðŸ + â’ðŸ
ðŸ = âšðŸ‘¥ = ðŸ‘¥

Step 3. Calculate the direction angles 
ðŸ¼ = ð‘ð‘ð‘ â¢â¢â¢â¢ [2/3] = 48.19â¢
ðŸ½ = ð‘ð‘ð‘ â¢â¢â¢â¢ [-1/3] = 109.47â¢
ðŸ¾ = ð‘ð‘ð‘ â¢â¢â¢â¢ [-2/3] = 131.81â¢

1.13 Free Fall

1.13.1 Definition
Free fall refers to the movement of an object under the exclusive influence of gravity, without the resistance of air or external forces. In free fall, an object accelerates downward due to gravity at a constant value, which on Earth is approximately 9.81 meters per second squared (m/s²).

The most notable and unexpected fact about the falling of objects is that if air resistance and friction are negligible, then in a given location all objects fall towards the center of the Earth with the same constant acceleration, regardless of their mass.

1.13.2 Characteristics

Some important characteristics of free fall include:

1. Constant acceleration: The acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Earth is constant, which means that the object's velocity increases by 9.81 m/s each second.
2. Vertical movement: Free fall is generally considered in a vertical downward direction, although it can also be applied to other contexts.
3. Absence of air resistance: In ideal free fall, it is assumed that there is no air resistance or other forces affecting the object, which makes the acceleration constant.
4. Equations of free fall: To describe the movement in free fall, equations of kinematics are used that relate position, velocity, and time.

One of the most well-known equations is:

1.13.3 Formula:
Free fall is a fundamental concept in physics and applies to a variety of situations, such as launching objects from a height, studying vertical movements, and mechanics of bodies in free fall. Its formula is: ð‘¦ = ðŸ“ˆ + ðŸ’¥0
ðŸ“ˆ âˆ’
1
2
ðŸ‘‚ðŸ“ˆ
2

which can also be rewritten as: h = (1/2) * g * t^2
v_f = v_0 - gt
Where:
h is the height or distance traveled [m].
g is the acceleration due to gravity [m/s²].
t is the time elapsed [s]. 
v_f is the final velocity, which is the velocity at the end of the trip [m/s]. 
v_0 is the initial velocity, which in free fall can be zero [m/s].

1.13.4 Example Application

Next, a problem with the following scenario will be presented: A ball falls from the top of a 98-meter building, with an initial velocity of 4.9 m/s when observed starting its movement. Calculate the time elapsed before reaching the floor and its speed before hitting the floor.

Step 1: Apply the position equation to obtain the value of time.
ðŸ‘¦ = ðŸ“ˆ + ðŸ’¥0
ðŸ“ˆ âˆ’
1
2
ðŸ‘‚ðŸ“ˆ
2

Where, taking the origin at the top of the building, we have:
ðŸ‘¦ = -98 m, ðŸ“ˆ = 0, ðŸ‘‚ = 9.8 m/s²
Finally, for the initial velocity, we have:
ðŸ’¥0 = âˆ’49 m/s

Step 2: Calculate the final velocity.
ðŸ‘£ðŸ‘ = ðŸ’¥0 âˆ’ ðŸ‘‚t
We substitute the values of initial velocity and gravity.
Here is the translation of the provided text to English:

Final Speed - Initial Velocity

Where:
• "Final velocity" refers to the speed of an object at a later time.
• "Initial velocity" refers to the speed of an object at an earlier time.

The change in velocity is a fundamental concept in kinematics and dynamics, and it is used to describe how objects move and respond to forces acting on them, for example, when we pull or push a chair, or when an object falls and its velocity changes, increasing due to the effect of gravity.

Example:
A racing horse accelerates from rest to a speed of 15.0 m/s towards the west in 1.80 seconds. What is its average acceleration or change in velocity?

Solution:
Step 1: Identify known values
Vi = 0 m/s
Vf = -15.0 m/s (Note: The negative sign indicates the direction towards the west)
Î”t = 1.80 s

Step 2: Calculate the change in velocity
âv = v2 - v1 = -15 - 0 = -15

Step 3: Calculate the acceleration.
a =
â†v
Î”t
=
-15.0
ð‘¸
1.80
ð‘¸
= -8.33 ð‘¸/s2

Note: The negative sign indicates that the acceleration vector is towards the west.

An elastic collision is any interaction between two or more objects that lasts relatively briefly, where both kinetic energy and linear momentum are conserved before and after the collision.

**Formula**
The formula for an elastic collision is:

ð‘» = ðŸ•µðŸ‘¸2 â’ ðŸ•µðŸ‘¹

Here is the translation of the text to English:

**1.20 Coefficient of Restitution**

The formula for the coefficient of restitution is:

ð is the coefficient of restitution.
ð‘‰ðŸ‘€1 is the initial velocity of object 1 (before the collision) in meters per second (m/s).
ð‘‰ðŸ‘€2 is the initial velocity of object 2 (before the collision) in meters per second (m/s).
ð‘‰ðŸ‘‚1 is the final velocity of object 1 (after the collision) in meters per second (m/s).
ð‘‰ðŸ‘‚2 is the final velocity of object 2 (after the collision) in meters per second (m/s).

**1.20.3 Example**

Here's an example of an inelastic collision: Two objects A and B moving along the x-axis in opposite directions, one facing the other, and approaching each other. Object A travels at 4 m/s to the right, object B moves at 2 m/s to the left, both objects collide inelastically and bounce off with a negative velocity of -3 m/s, where the coefficient of restitution is 0.8, determine the final velocity of object B.

The problem data are:
ð‘‰ðŸ‘€1 = 4 ðŸš”/ðŸ•´ , ð‘‰ðŸ‘€2 = âˆ’2 ðŸš”/ðŸ•´ , ð‘‰ðŸ‘‚1 = âˆ’3 ðŸš”/ðŸ•´ , ð‘’ = 0.8

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
ð‘’ =
ð‘‰ðŸ‘‚2 âˆ’ ð‘‰ðŸ‘‚1
ð‘‰ðŸ‘€1 âˆ’ ð‘‰ðŸ‘€2

**1.21 Elastic or Completely Inelastic Collision**

**1.21.1 Definition**

In an elastic or completely inelastic collision, the objects remain united after the collision, where the total momentum is conserved, but not the kinetic energy, and the coefficient of restitution is equal to zero.

**1.21.2 Formulas**

The formulas for elastic or completely inelastic collision are:

ð‘’ =
ð‘‰ðŸ‘‚2 âˆ’ ð‘‰ðŸ‘‚1
ð‘‰ðŸ‘€1 âˆ’ ð‘‰ðŸ‘€2
ð‘š1ð‘‰ðŸ‘€1 + ð‘š2ð‘‰ðŸ‘€2 = ð‘š1ð‘‰ðŸ‘‚1 + ð‘š2ð‘‰ðŸ‘‚2

**1.21.3 Example**

Here's an example of an elastic or completely inelastic collision: Two objects A and B with equal mass moving along the x-axis in opposite directions, one facing the other, and approaching each other. Object A travels at 4 m/s to the right, object B moves at 2 m/s to the left, both objects collide completely inelastically, determine the final velocity of the two objects.

Step 1: Identify the problem data:
ð‘‰ðŸ‘€1 = 4 ðŸš”/ðŸ•´
ð‘‰ðŸ‘€2 = âˆ’2 ðŸš”/ðŸ•´
ð‘š1 = ð‘š2
ð‘’ = 0 because the collision is completely inelastic

Step 2: Substitute these values into the first formula, we get:
ð‘’ =
ð‘‰ðŸ‘‚2 âˆ’ ð‘‰ðŸ‘‚1
ð‘‰ðŸ‘€1 âˆ’ �‘‰ðŸ‘€2
= 0
ð‘‰ðŸ‘‚1 = ð‘‰ðŸ‘‚2

Considering that the final velocities are equal, ð‘‰ðŸ‘‚1 = Ý“² = ðŸš”/ðŸ•´, and that the masses are equal, ð‘š1 = Ý“² = ðŸš², substituting values into the second formula yields:
ð‘š(4) + ð‘š(âˆ’2) = ð‘š(ð‘‰ðŸ‘‚) + ð‘š(ð‘‰ðŸ‘‚)
2ð‘š = 2ð‘š(ðŸš”/ðŸ•´)
ðŸš”/ðŸ•´ = 1 ðŸš”/ðŸ•´

This result indicates that after the collision, the two objects move together to the right at a velocity of 1 m/s.

**Coefficient of restitution**

**1.25 Coefficient of restitution**

The coefficient of restitution represents the degree of elasticity in the collision of two masses in one dimension. If the coefficient is 1, the collision is elastic. If the coefficient is greater than 0 and less than 1, the collision is inelastic. If the coefficient is 0, the collision is completely inelastic.

**1.25.2 Formula**

The formula for the coefficient of restitution is:

ð = ð‘‰ð‘“² â ð‘‰ð‘“¹
ð‘‰ð‘œ¹ â ð‘‰ð‘œ²

In this formula, ð‘’ represents the coefficient of restitution. ð‘‰ð‘œ¹ is the initial velocity of object 1 (before the collision) in meters per second (m/s). ð‘‰ð‘œ² is the initial velocity of object 2 (before the collision) in meters per second (m/s). ð‘‰ð‘“¹ is the final velocity of object 1 (after the collision) in meters per second (m/s). ð‘‰ð‘“² is the final velocity of object 2 (after the collision) in meters per second (m/s).

**1.25.3 Example**

Here's an example of applying the coefficient of restitution to a problem: two objects A and B moving along the X-axis in opposite directions, with object A traveling at 4 m/s to the right and object B moving at 2 m/s to the left, they collide head-on and object A rebounds with a negative velocity of -3 m/s, and object B rebounds to the right at a speed of 1.8 m/s. Determine the coefficient of restitution.

The data for the problem are:

ð‘‰ð‘œ¹ = 4 ðŸ”·/s, ð‘‰ð‘œ² = â’2 ðŸ”·/s, ð‘‰ð‘“¹ = â’3 ðŸ”·/s, ð‘‰ð‘“² = 1.8 ðŸ”·/s,

Substituting these values into the formula gives:

ð‘’ = (1.8) â’ (-3)
4 â’ (-2)
= 0.8

The coefficient of restitution is 0.8, which indicates that the collision is inelastic.

1.30.1 Definition
Rotational Dynamics, also known as rotational mechanics, is a branch of physics that focuses on studying the movement of objects that rotate around an axis or central point. Unlike linear dynamics, which deals with rectilinear motion, rotational dynamics aims to understand how objects spin and respond to applied forces.

Important concepts in rotational dynamics include angular momentum, torque (rotational force), rotational inertia, and laws of rotational motion, which are analogous to Newton's laws of motion for linear dynamics.

This branch of physics is essential for understanding how rotating objects work, such as wheels, pulleys, gearboxes, and rotation systems in general. Rotational Dynamics is fundamental in fields such as mechanical engineering and applied physics.

**1.51 Frictional Force**

**1.51.1 Definition**

Frictional force arises when an object and a surface enter into contact, and can be static when the object is at rest or dynamic when it is in motion.

**1.51.2 Formulas**

Examine the formula for calculating the frictional force, which results from the product of the coefficient of friction by the normal force:

F = ï­ × N

or

F = ï­ × N

In these formulas to determine static and dynamic friction forces:

F is the static or dynamic friction force in Newtons (N).
ï­ is the value of the static coefficient of friction, with no units.
ï­ is the value of the dynamic coefficient of friction, with no units.
N is the value of the normal force in Newtons (N).

ï­ = 0.4
Sustituyendo these values, first, to determine the normal force on a horizontal plane, we have that:
N = m × g = (4 kg)(9.81 m/s²) = 39.24 N

Now that you have obtained the value of the normal force, you use the formula to determine the static frictional force, which is:

F = ï­ × N = (0.4)(39.24 N) = 15.7 N

**Section 1.53 Force in a Spring**

**Definition**
The concept of force in a spring is directly proportional to the distance it is stretched or compressed, and opposite in direction. The constant of proportionality is the spring constant k.

**Formulas**
The formula for the force in a spring is equal to the negative product of the spring constant and its deformation.
F = -kx

In this formula, F is the force produced by the spring in Newtons (N), x is the distance it is stretched or compressed in meters (m).

**Example Application**
Review the following example application of force in a spring:
Three passengers with a total mass of 210 kilograms get on a vehicle weighing 1100 kilograms, compressing the car's springs 4 centimeters. Assuming that the springs act as a single spring, calculate: The spring constant of the vehicle's springs.
The problem data are:
m1 = 210 kg, m2 = 1100 kg,
x = 4 cm = 0.04 m
First, you obtain the total mass:
m_total = 210 kg + 1100 kg = 1310 kg
On the other hand, the spring produces a force that supports the total weight, i.e., F = -kx.
F = -k(0.04)
Despejando to get the spring constant, you have:
k =
m_total * g / x
= (1310) * 9.81 / 0.04
= 3212775 N/m

The response to the example application of force in a spring is: The spring constant is 3212775 N/m.

**Section 1.54 Non-Conservative Force**

**Definition**
A non-conservative force is one that produces work, where the value of the work depends on the path taken between two points, i.e., the value of the work is not independent of the path taken between these two points. These forces remove energy from the physical system.

**Formula (none)**
No formula

**Example Application**
Review the following example application of non-conservative force:
A block slides over a surface with friction until it comes to rest, the frictional force is an example of a non-conservative force, as it removes energy from the block.

**Section 1.55 Normal Force**

**Definition**
The normal force arises from contact between an object and a surface or plane and acts always perpendicular to the contact surface. It is the force that prevents the object from passing through the surface with which it is in contact.

**Formula (none)**
No formula

**Example Application**
Review the following example application of normal force:
If a 5.0-kilogram cat stands on a 15-kilogram chair that is at rest on the floor, what magnitude in Newtons will the normal force exerted by the floor on the chair be?
The result to the example application of normal force is: 196 N

**1.57 Impulse**

**1.57.1 Description**

Impulse is a physical vector quantity that generates a force applied to an object over a certain time, resulting in a change in the object's motion, i.e., changing its velocity.

**1.57.2 Formula**

The formula for impulse is multiplying the force by the time it is applied.

ð¼ = ð¹ â¢ ð‘¡
ð¼ = ðŸ’ª(ðŸ’ª â¢ ðŸ” â¢ - ðŸ” â¢)

In these formulas to determine impulse:

ð¼ is the impulse, a vector quantity in newtons per second (Nâ¢s).
ð¹ is the net force applied in newtons (N).
ðŸ‘¡ is the time in seconds (s).
ðŸ’ª is the mass of the object in kilograms (kg).
ðŸ” â¢ ðŸ” â¢ is the initial velocity of the object in meters per second (m/s).
ðŸ” â¢ ðŸ” â¢ is the final velocity of the object in meters per second (m/s).

**1.57.3 Example of Application**

You can see an example of applying impulse in the following problem:

A person throws a ball horizontally to the left at a speed of 30 m/s, against a vertical wall, and after hitting the wall, the ball rebounds horizontally to the right at a speed of 20 m/s. Calculate the impulse on the ball during the impact.

The data for the problem are:

ðŸ’ª = 400 ðŸ‘”ðŸ‘ = 0.4 ðŸ“±
ðŸ” â¢ ðŸ” â¢ = -30 ðŸ•³/ðŸ•¸ , ðŸ” â¢ ðŸ” â¢ = 20 ðŸ•³/ðŸ•¸

Substituting these values into the impulse formula in terms of the object's mass and velocities, we get:

ð¼ = ðŸ’ª(ðŸ” â¢ ðŸ” â¢ - ðŸ” â¢) = 0.4 [20 - (-30)] = 20 Nâ€¢s

The magnitude of the impulse is 20 Nâ€¢s (newton per second).

1.63 Mechanics

1.63.1 Definition
Mechanics is a branch of physics that studies everything related to the movement of bodies. It is divided into kinematics, dynamics, and statics. Kinematics describes the movement of bodies considering the space in which it moves and its dependence on time. Dynamics analyzes the movement of objects considering the causes that originate this movement, which involve forces and different types of energy. Statics analyzes the causes why objects are in a state of rest, also known as equilibrium.

An example of kinematic application is the description of the movement of a projectile, from knowing its position and velocity at time zero until finding the mathematical relationships that describe its entire trajectory as a function of time. An example of dynamics is when considering the forces acting on the body to generate its movement and during this, such as the force applied at the beginning of the throw, the gravitational force during flight, the air resistance force, and the buoyant force. These forces will describe why the object will describe such or such trajectory. In this analysis, we use the free-body diagram, where we draw all the forces acting on the body.

1.66 Angular momentum
1.66.1 Definition
The angular momentum of a particle with respect to the origin is defined as 
the cross product of the position vector of the particle and its linear momentum.

1.66.2 Formula
Angular momentum is determined by the cross product of the position vector of 
the particle and the linear momentum vector.
ð¿â = ð‘Ÿ × ð‘ = ð‘Ÿ × ð‘¥ð‘£ = ð‘¥ð‘Ÿ × ð‘£

In this equation:
ð¿âƒ is the angular momentum vector in units of kilogram per meter squared 
per second (kg m²/s)
ð‘Ÿ is the position vector of the particle in units of meters
ð‘ is the linear momentum, which is equal to the mass ð‘¥ of the particle 
in units of kilograms (kg) multiplied by its velocity ð‘£ in units of meters per second (m/s)

The magnitude of the angular momentum can be expressed by the equation:
ð¿ = ð‘¥ð‘Ÿð‘£ð‘‚ð‘›(ð•µ)
Where:
ð¿ is the magnitude of the linear momentum in units of kilogram per meter squared 
per second (kg m²/s)
ð‘¥ is the mass of the particle in units of kilograms (kg)
ð‘£ is the velocity of the particle in units of meters per second (m/s) and the angle ð•µ
is the angle formed between the vectors ð‘Ÿ and ð‘£

1.66.3 Example application
Determine the linear velocity of a 40-kilogram child who is located at 
the end of a rotating platform with a radius of 2 meters, with an angular momentum of 400 
kilograms per meter squared over second.

In this example, we can use the equation for the magnitude of the vector of linear momentum:
ð¿ = ð‘¥ð‘Ÿð‘£ð‘‚ð‘›(ð•µ)

Since the particle is rotating on a platform, the velocity vector is always 
tangential to the circle formed by the rotation of the platform, and the position vector is measured from the center of rotation of the platform, so both vectors will form an angle of 90°
and then solving for the velocity in the equation above, we have:
ð‘£ =
ð¿
ð‘¥ð‘Ÿð‘‚ð‘›(ð•µ)
ð‘£ =
400 kg m²/s
40 kg × (2) × 1 (since it's a circular motion)
ð‘£ = 5 kg/m

**1.112 Frictional Energy**

Frictional energy is the amount of kinetic energy that transforms into heat through friction.

It can be calculated like any other work: as the product of the force with the displacement of the object acting on it.

1.112.2 Formula

The formula for the work done by friction is when the work done by the frictional force is equal to the product of the vector force of friction and the vector displacement.

ð‘Š = ðŸ’°ðŸ½ × âš¨
âˆ¥ âˆ†í±Ÿ

Where ðŸ’°ðŸ½ is the coefficient of kinetic friction, ðŸ is the magnitude of the normal force to the surface equal to the weight of the body, but with a positive sign. ðŸ‘£ is the displacement vector.

1.112.3 Example Application

You can see an example application of work done by friction in the following problem:

Due to strong rain, a 12,000 kg car loses control and slides on the wet pavement with a kinetic friction coefficient of 0.20. If the car slides 130 meters until it comes to a complete stop, what work did the friction do on the car along this displacement?

As friction is a vector that opposes the body's movement, the product point calculation for work is minus the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors:

ð‘Š = âˆ’ðŸ’°ðŸ½ × 12,000 kg × 9.81 m/s² × 2 × 130 m
= âˆ’306,072 J

The response to the example application on work done by friction is: -306,072 Joules.

**1.113 Work-Net Example**

The work-net example shows how to apply the concept of work and energy in a real-world scenario. For instance, consider a body of 5 kilograms that starts from rest and gains a velocity of 10 meters per second due to three external forces applied. What is the total work done by these forces?

**1.114 Work Done by a Constant Force**

The formula for work done by a constant force is equal to the scalar product, dot product, of the force vector and the displacement vector. This can also be written as the product of the magnitudes of the force vector and the displacement vector times the cosine of the angle between them.

**1.115 Work Done by a Force**

Work done by a force is a form of energy produced by a force applied to an object during its displacement. The force can be constant or variable.

**Formula**

The work done by a constant force on an object is equal to the scalar product, dot product, of the constant force vector and the displacement vector. This can also be written as the product of the magnitudes of the force vector and the displacement vector times the cosine of the angle between them.

For a variable force, the work done is equal to the integral of the product of the force vector and the infinitesimal displacement that describes the object's trajectory.

**Example Application**
